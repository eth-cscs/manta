//! Node migration between HSM groups.
//!
//! vCluster backup/restore are 1:1 pass-throughs to the backend
//! dispatcher; handlers call those directly. Only `migrate_nodes`
//! carries real orchestration (hosts-expression resolution,
//! HSM-group curation, per-pair member migration).
//!
//! Migration is a (target × parent) fan-out: for every requested
//! target group, every parent group the resolved xnames actually
//! belong to is paired with it and the backend
//! `migrate_group_members` call is issued. Nodes that don't live in
//! one of the named parents are silently skipped, which keeps the
//! call idempotent when a hosts expression is re-run.
