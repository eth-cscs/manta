//! Wire types shared between the `manta-cli` and `manta-server`
//! binaries — the CLI↔server API contract.
//!
//! Everything in this module is "wire-shaped" data: request/response
//! bodies, query-string structs, and CLI-built parameter structs
//! (`api/`), response DTOs re-exported from upstream crates (`dto`),
//! plus pure helpers that operate on those
//! types (`cluster_status`). There is no business logic and no I/O;
//! this module depends only on `serde`, `utoipa`, and
//! `manta-backend-dispatcher` type re-exports. Anything that performs
//! work — config loading, tracing init, error conversion — lives in
//! [`super::common`].
